# Intro to Java
FRC Team 2168's Java lessons were initally created by Kevin Harrilal in 2014. They were adapted by select members of the programming subteam, including [Cierra](https://github.com/CierraO), [Nate](https://github.com/natejank), and [Conor](https://github.com/Conor7567), in 2020, then further modified and expanded upon in 2024 by Nate and Cierra.

The lesson reviews and labs were created by Cierra (with the exception of lab 5, which was created by Nate) in 2020 and then edited by her and Nate in 2024.

Here we will compile the lesson slideshows, reviews, practice exercises, and lesson videos based on the slideshows.

The videos were created in order to show future students how these lessons should be taught, as well as to provide others with free Java lessons.

**Note about review slideshows:** The review questions are intended to be shown to students as they write their answers down on a sheet of paper. Then, after students have answered all questions, papers are collected and we go over each question. Thus, the question slides are duplicated, with the second set featuring animations that show the answers.
