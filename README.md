# Intro to Java
FRC Team 2168's Java lessons were initally created by Kevin Harrilal in 2014. They were adapted by select members of the programming subteam, including [myself](https://github.com/CierraO), in 2020.

The lesson reviews and labs were created by me throughout the past few years.

Here I will compile the lesson slideshows, reviews, practice exercises, and lesson videos based on the slideshows.

The videos were created in order to show future students how these lessons should be taught, as well as to provide others with free Java lessons.

## Lesson 1

- what Java is
